# Final Project
## Segment 1 
### Topic 
NASA provides data on the impact of meteorites on earth's surface. A meteorite is specifically a meteor that makes it through the atmosphere of a planet or moon. In this case, our data looks at meteorites that break the earth's atmosphere. Our team selected this topic because we have all had a fascination with space from early childhood. Additionally, we are trying to get in NASA's good graces for future job opportunities. ;) 

Our team communicates regularly via slack and a group chat. We also plan to consistently meet on Saturdays. Our team dynamic consists of working on the majority of the work together, while ensuring our respective roles are completed for that week. I am happy to say our team is blessed to have a very dependable and highly communicative bunch. 

### Data Source 

The meteorite data is sourced from data.nasa.gov and can be found at the following link: 

https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh

The data includes the names, ID's, name types, mass, and coordinates of the meteorites that have hit earth. Using this data, we want to create a well put-together dashboard that will display the location of meteorite landing on earth. After properly sorting through our data and creating an interactive map, Machine Learning will be used to explore questions that go beyond the data. Linear regression will answer the following questions: Which continent has had the most meteorite hits? Based on the historical date, where and when will the next meteorite hit be?

### Tools 

We plan on using Python to clean and analyze our data, PgAdmin for our databases, Tableau to display the story of our dashboard, and a linear regression model to answer our questions. 

### Summary 

The most interesting way to interact with NASA's meteorite data is to see it visually displayed. Corelating the meteorites landings with the location visually on a map with be the main part of this project. To take the data a step further, Machine Learning will predict the locations and times of the next few meteorite hits.
