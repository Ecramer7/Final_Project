# Final Project
## Segment 1 
### Topic 
NASA provides data on the impact of meteorites on earth's surface. A meteorite is specifically a meteor that makes it through the atmosphere of a planet or moon. In this case, our data looks at meteorites that break the earth's atmosphere. 

Using our data, we want to create a well put-together dashboard that will display the location of meteorite landing on earth. After properly sorting through our data and creating an interactive map, Machine Learning will be used to explore questions that go beyond the data. Linear regression will answer the following questions: Which continent has had the most meteorite hits? Based on the historical date, where and when will the next meteorite hit be? 

### Data Source 

The meteorite data is sourced from data.nasa.gov and can be found at the following link: 

https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh

The data includes the names, ID's, name types, mass, and coordinates of the meteorites that have hit earth. 

### Summary 

The most interesting way to interact with NASA's meteorite data is to see it visually displayed. Corelating the meteorites landings with the location visually on a map with be the main part of this project. To take the data a step further, Machine Learning will hopefully predict meteorites the location and times of the next hit.
