# Final Project
## Segment 1 
### Topic 
NASA provides data on the impact of meteoritess on earth's surface. A meteorite is specifically a meteor that makes it through the atmosphere of a planet or moon. In this case, our data looks at meteorites that break the earth's atmosphere. 

Using our data, we want to create a well put-together dashboard that will display the location of meateorite landing on earth. After properly sorting through our data and creating an interactive map, Machine Learning will be used to explore questions that go beyond the data. Using linear regression, we will anser the questions of: Which continent has had the most meateroite hits? Based on the historical date, where and when will the next meteorite hit be? 

### Data Source 

The meteorite data was pulled form data.nasa.gov and can be found at the following link: 

https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh

The data includes the names, ID's, name types, mass, and coordinates of the meateorites that have hit earth.
